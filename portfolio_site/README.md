# Portfolio Website - Nishant Bimra

This is a simple, responsive static portfolio website you can host anywhere (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or your own server).

## What's included
- `index.html` — single-page portfolio with sections: hero, about, projects, skills, contact.
- `styles.css` — modern responsive CSS.
- `script.js` — small client-side JS for form demo and smooth scrolling.
- `assets/` — placeholder SVG images and a dummy resume PDF.
- `README.md` — this file.

## How to use
1. Unzip `portfolio_site.zip`.
2. Replace placeholder content and `assets/Nishant_Bimra_Resume.pdf` with your real resume (optional).
3. Edit email in the contact section (`index.html`) to your email address.
4. To preview locally, open `index.html` in a browser.

## Hosting suggestions
- Push to a GitHub repo and enable GitHub Pages (branch: `main`, folder: `/`).
- Drag-and-drop the folder to Netlify or Vercel for instant hosting.

## Customization tips
- Replace the project cards with your actual project links and screenshots.
- Update colors in `styles.css` to match your branding.
- Add meta/social tags for better link previews.

Enjoy — and if you want, I can convert this to a React project, add real demo pages, or wire the contact form to an email service.
